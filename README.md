# Raycasting using LÖVE 2D



This implementation is almost entirely a translation of a code written in Javascript using the p5.js library, originally written by Daniel Shiffman from Coding Train in this [video here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOEi6T2mtHo) . His channel is awesome!!!



### Things to implement:

* [ ] Turn resolution independent (no hardcoding 🙅‍♂️)
* [ ] Implement a FOV to the particle
* [ ] Create an interface with controls for debugging and toggle the options
* [ ] Let the user draw the walls
